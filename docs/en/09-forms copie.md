## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to provide simplified but user friendly forms for the execution of the process.

## Instructions overview

Duplicate the process diagram from the previous exercise to create a *2.1.0* version.

Create the following forms:
- A case instantiation form at pool level that sets the *leaveStart* and *dayCount* attribute of *leaveRequest* business variable
- A form for the *Validate request* task that displays the requestor user details, the *leaveStart* and *dayCount* data in read-only mode and that sets the *isApproved* data

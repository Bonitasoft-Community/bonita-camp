The goal of the exercises it to create a basic leave request process.

The process will execute in the following way:
1. An employee requests a leave
1. The employee's manager approves or denies the request

In order to implement this process we are going to follow an iterative approach mixing theoretical content and practical exercises. Each exercise will allow you to build an executable and more complete version of the process.

Each exercise is divided in 3 sections:
1. **Goal**: introduce the objectives of the exercise
1. **Instructions overview**: provides an overview of the main steps required for completing the exercise
1. **Step by step instructions**: contains a step by step description of actions required to complete the exercise
